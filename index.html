    <h1>SMB3 Movement</h1>
    <p>
        This project is a simple example of how to use the EbitenEngine to program the physics of a platformer game
        inspired by the movement of Super Mario Bros 3. Although the movement is not 100% identical, it has the very
        same feeling of SMB3.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hard work demystifying the movement physics of SMB3, was done by NES Hacker, who wrote the assembly NES
        code. You can find his source code <a href="https://github.com/NesHacker/PlatformerMovement/">here</a>, and a
        video explaining it as well <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuKIUjw_tNU">here</a>.

    <p>Please consider subscribing to NES Hacker, the guy is awesome :D</p>
    <p>This project is an implementation written in Go programming language and uses EbitenEngine.</p>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>Keyboard: Z and X</p>
